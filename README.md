# My portfolio website. 

I don't need to explain why I created this website as a frontend developer, right?
So, here I want to share why I did this design and what helped me.

# Why this design?

When I decided to create a portfolio website, I actually didn't have a design in mind.
Of course, I wanted it to be unique, but it turned out much better than I expected, which I'm very proud and satisfied of.

Inspiration came out of nowhere. I often use Pinterest not only for inspiration, but for entertainment in general. 
I was scrolling through it and found some beautiful pictures with editing that I really liked. Pictures by themselves were different, but the editing was the same. 
There is something about it, some atmosphere that I felt, and that feeling became my inspiration. 

When I thought about design, I couldn't picture something particular, because my inspiration was **the feeling**, and I really wanted to give the visitors of my site the opportunity to experience that same feeling. 

While creating the website, when I felt lost or couldn't think of any ways to design some part of the portfolio, I went back to [board that I created](https://pin.it/69rxmhh) with those pictures and more alike them to experience the feeling again and with that go back to developing.
